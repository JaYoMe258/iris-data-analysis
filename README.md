# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes the famous Iris flower dataset using Python's data science stack. It demonstrates data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques.

## Objectives
- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Perform statistical analysis
- Create insightful visualizations
- Demonstrate data science workflow

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (basic visualization)
- Seaborn (advanced visualization)
- scikit-learn (dataset loading)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook iris_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Key Insights
1. Setosa flowers have distinctly smaller petals
2. Virginica specimens are generally the largest
3. Sepal width shows approximately normal distribution
4. Strong correlation exists between petal length and width

## Reflections
This project helped me:
- Practice complete data analysis workflow
- Learn effective visualization techniques
- Understand the importance of data cleaning
- Develop skills in communicating findings
